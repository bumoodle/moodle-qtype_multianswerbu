Expanded Cloze/MultiAnswer Question Type for Moodle@BU

This expanded Cloze question type works very much like the normal MultiAnswer/Cloze question type, but allows several additional question types to be entered. In the near future, it should be replaced by a nicer, unified MultiAnswer question type, which will be generalized to support all question types with an embeddable interface.
